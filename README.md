# Fortify

Since customers cannot see Fortify FPR reports, exported PDF reports can be too complex for customers to get lost. **fpr2xlsx.py** is developed with an aim to help customers understand Fortify reports better. Script requires Python xlsxwriter library installed. It only requires one parameter (--input or -i) to choose fpr report file, after that resulting xlsx file is created with the same name.
